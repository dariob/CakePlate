# CakePlate

CakePlate is a best practice template for CakePHP based web applications, inspired by http://html5boilerplate.com.  It is a mashup of lots of open source projects and snippets - so a majority of the credit should not go to us. 

**NOTE** CakePlate is no way associated with the Cake Software Foundation, or CakePHP.  We love CakePHP and are merely trying to spread the love and make peoples lives easier by saving them time. 

We only include open source code that we have personally used, and know works.

## Installing

Clone. Make sure your webroot dir is writeable by your webserver user (ubuntu: www-data) - or for production server, make a webroot/cjs and webroot/ccss and make those writeable. [Become famliar with the framework](http://book.cakephp.org/view/875/x1-3-Collection). Look at the source as there are lots of comments inline.  Documentation (examples etc) will get better over time.

## Issues

Please report any issues OR suggestions to the [issue tracker](http://github.com/rynop/CakePlate/issues) on github.

If you feel you contributed to this (maybe though html5boilerplate.com) and we missed you on our credits/thanks list, send us a message and we will be more then happy to include your name (and a link to your site).

## Ideas?

Got something you think should be added? use the github issue tracker.

## We are looking for help

We are currently looking for someone who can make a few sample files that we can include in CakePlate.  It can be some thing as simple as an example model, view, controller (or whater else) that leverages as much of the things we have included as possible. Extra credit would be a full blown demo app that uses CakePlate complete with .sql load file.
